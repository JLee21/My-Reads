### About the Project

This project aims to develop a way to "Think in React".
A user is able to search for a book within a dynamic search bar and the user can select a book and place it on a virtual bookshelf.

Some of the key principles applied:

* Use reusable, state-less functional components such as Book and BookShelf
* Use state components in order to keep track of which shelf a book is on
* Use ReactRouter to allow a user to navigate the web app
