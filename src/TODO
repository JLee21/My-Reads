* Make Search PureComponent, right now, it updates anytime state books changes.
* Make BookShelf a PureComponent. Only change if its props have changed.
* Mark disabled select option.

* Note that parenthesis and brackets in arrow functions.
  Use parenthesis when creating JSX. Otherwise, you'd need to use brackets AND a return.
* You can only destructure props while in render method (this applies if you're in a class component)
* When destructuring, all variable names have to match. Called `named imports`

* I need to not filter/loop through books in this render(). the books may not be available at that time.
  There's too much junk in the render part of Route.

  All three render methods will be passed the same three route props.

  * match
  * location
  * history


  --> Rearrange the code so that it's more declarative. Ie, if there are no books to be passed as props, then the render func won't fire.

* How will my state pass to each component if the components are within <Route />

      <Router>
        <Switch>
          <Route exact path='/' component={App}/>
          <Route path='/search' component={Search} />
        </Switch>
      </Router>

    --> Use

      render={() => (<Comp stuff={propsStuff})}

---

  * When outside of render, this will work

    const books = this.state.books;

  but not this

    const { books } = this.state.books;
