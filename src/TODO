* I need to not filter/loop through books in this render(). the books may not be available at that time.
  There's too much junk in the render part of Route.

  All three render methods will be passed the same three route props.

  match
  location
  history


* How will my state pass to each component if the components are within <Route />
    <Router>
      <Switch>
        <Route exact path='/' component={App}/>
        <Route path='/search' component={Search} />
      </Switch>
    </Router>

* Make Search PureComponent, right now, it updates anytime state books changes.
* List books on main page.
* Mark disabled select option.
* Make BookShelf a PureComponent. Only change if its props have changed.
* Do not duplicate SHELVES in Book with the select thing.

* Make a list of authors as there are bunched together.
* Remove book from Search page as soon a shelf is selected.

L E S S O N S
* Note that parenthesis and brackets in arrow functions.
  Use parenthesis when creating JSX. Otherwise, you'd need to use brackets AND a return.
* You can only destructure props while in render method (this applies if you're in a class component)
* When destructuring, all variable names have to match.

Q U E S T I O N S
* What if I want to pass props to a component that is inside a <Route />?
  <Route path='/search' component={Search} />
